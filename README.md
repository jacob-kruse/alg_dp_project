The code for this project is written in Python, and the scripts `dp.py`, `dp_bonus_1.py`, and `dp_bonus_2.py` make up the main code for the Pairwise Alignment of 2 DNA sequences. 

Test cases can be found in `test_cases.txt` to quickly input two DNA sequences for Pairwise Aligment in any of the Python scripts.
